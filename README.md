# PacMen-Exercise

The PacMen exercise combined our previous knowledge of creating a pacman and moving it across the screen. This exercise allowed for pacmen to be created on demand by clicking as single button. It also required movement of the pacmen not only across the screen but diagonally as well. To run this exercise go to https://meschaak.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/ and "start game" then add additional pacmen.
